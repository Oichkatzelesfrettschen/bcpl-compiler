BCPLC README

This is an x86 (IA-32) and x86_64 with BIOS and UEFI (x64) port of the "classic" old BCPL compiler
(around 1980) from the Tripos Research Group at Cambridge University. Experimental support exists for retro-modern x86 (IA-16) systems, 
for the compiler written in Chicken Scheme, written in Haskell, Written in Haskell orchestrating C via chicken scheme, and written in Go! 

BCPL was a popular systems programming language during the 1960s
and 1970s, and is of great historical importance: about the time
of the birth of UNIX, BCPL directly inspired the computer language
B and thus had a very big influence on the development of C.

The compiler available here is very close to that featured in the
book, _BCPL: the language and its compiler_ by Martin Richards and
Colin Whitby-Stevens (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979).

As a real, working computer language implementation, that can be
studied, modified, and played with, the classic BCPL compiler has
a good deal to recommend it. The compiler frontend consists of
only about 2000 lines of BCPL code, and (as supplied here) compiles
to a static (fully-linked) x86 binary that is less than 36000 bytes
in size.

The present distribution supplies a compiler backend (OCODE to x86
code generator), together with peephole optimizer, and reasonably
extensive runtime support. A few revisions have been made to the
compiler frontend -- it looks for header files in a standard location,
for instance -- and  the runtime incorporates support for UNIX
command line arguments and error reporting. Some documentation
that formed part of the original BCPL distribution tape is also
included, as are a few utility programs.

Requirements
============

The compiler relies on a standard set of development tools.  Ensure at
least the following packages are available::

    clang
    make
    cmake
    binutils
    gcc-multilib
    qemu

Running ``./scripts/setup.sh`` installs all of the above along with a full
cross‑compilation environment and the IA‑16 toolchain.

Building

## Performance Optimization

This distribution includes comprehensive optimization scripts and documentation
for building high-performance BCPL compiler binaries using modern Clang/LLVM
optimization techniques.

### Quick Start - Optimized Builds

For maximum performance on your current hardware:
```bash
./build_max_performance.sh
```

For high performance with binary portability:
```bash
./build_portable_optimized.sh
```

For Profile-Guided Optimization (highest performance for specific workloads):
```bash
./build_pgo.sh
```

### Optimization Documentation

- **[Complete Optimization Guide](docs/BUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md)** - Comprehensive guide covering all optimization techniques
- **[Quick Reference](docs/OPTIMIZATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Command reference and troubleshooting
- **[Optimization Overview](docs/README_OPTIMIZATION.md)** - Summary of all available optimization strategies

### Performance Comparison

To build all optimization variants and compare their performance:
```bash
./build_variants.sh       # Build all optimization levels
./benchmark_variants.sh   # Run comprehensive benchmarks
```

The optimization scripts use advanced Clang/LLVM features including:
- Link-Time Optimization (ThinLTO)
- Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)
- Advanced vectorization
- CPU-specific optimizations
- Memory hierarchy optimization

## Standard Building

Before building you may install a comprehensive cross‑compilation
environment by running ``./scripts/setup.sh`` as root.  The script configures
package repositories for multiple architectures and installs toolchains
and emulators such as ``qemu`` to enable execution of foreign binaries,
including 16‑bit and 32‑bit x86 programs.  This is optional for a
straightforward native build but recommended when targeting older or
non‑native platforms.

To build the compiler from the top-level directory, run::

    ./scripts/makeall.sh
    ./scripts/makeall.sh install

The build now requires the Clang compiler with C23 support.  The
Makefile selects ``clang`` by default, so no extra arguments are
needed.  Use ``CC=gcc`` or another compiler only if it understands
C23.

Alternatively, you can build directly within ``src/``::

    make -C src
    make -C src install

The Makefiles and CMake build files default to a 64-bit runtime.
Specify ``BITS=32`` (or ``-DBITS=32`` when using CMake) for a 32-bit
runtime or ``BITS=16`` for the experimental IA‑16 build.  Cross builds
may also set ``CROSS_PREFIX`` (for example ``CROSS_PREFIX=i686-linux-gnu-``
or ``CROSS_PREFIX=ia16-elf-``) to select alternate assembler and linker
commands.  The BCPL word size (``WORDSZ``) is selected automatically from
``BITS`` and will be 8 bytes for a 64-bit build, 4 bytes for 32 bit and
2 bytes for 16 bit.

After installation, verify the compiler by running::

    bcplc tools/cmpltest.bcpl

By default the runtime is 64 bit, so running under ``qemu-i386`` is no
longer required.  A 32-bit build remains available for older
environments via ``BITS=32`` or ``-DBITS=32``.

This should print::

    119 TESTS COMPLETED, 0 FAILURE(S)

Martin Richards, the originator of BCPL, has a home page at

    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/

Richards has continued to develop BCPL, very much as though it were
still a living language, and has a large and complex distribution
of "present day" BCPL available, together with some archive materials.

Build

See INSTALL for detailed build instructions. Build the compiler with

    ./scripts/makeall.sh

and then install it, optionally overriding `PREFIX` to choose an
installation directory:

    ./scripts/makeall.sh install

The project also provides CMake files.  A typical out-of-tree build
looks like::

    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
    cmake --build build
    cmake --install build

The CMake build regenerates ``st.s`` using the freshly built code
generator by default.  Set ``-DBOOTSTRAP=OFF`` to skip this step.  The
``tools`` and ``docs`` targets may be built from the same build
directory.

Ensure the resulting `bcplc` driver is on your `PATH` (or supply a
`BC` variable pointing to it).  If the driver has not yet been
installed, the tests can be run with the freshly built copy in
``src/``.  The driver automatically searches its own directory for the
runtime components, so no installation is required::

    make -C tools BC=../src/bcplc test

After installation the shorter

    make test

will also compile and execute the "cmpltest" suite using the
64-bit runtime system.

Experimental Chicken Scheme Port
-------------------------------
An early experiment using [Chicken Scheme](https://call-cc.org/) lives in
the `ports/chicken/` directory.  It is not built by default and currently
contains only stubs.  Consult `ports/chicken/README.md` for more information.

Experimental Go Port
====================

The `experiments/bcpl-go` directory contains an in-progress rewrite of
selected components in Go.  The module targets Go 1.24 and currently
implements a basic version of the `bcplc` driver.  Tests can be run with

    go test ./experiments/bcpl-go

The port is incomplete but provides a starting point for further
translation and refactoring in Go.

Experimental LLVM Backend
=========================

An optional tool named ``llcg`` can translate OCODE directly to LLVM IR.
When LLVM is available, build it alongside ``cg`` and ``op`` via::

    make -C src llcg

or with CMake in an out-of-tree build::

    cmake -S . -B build -DLLVM_DIR=/path/to/llvm/cmake
    cmake --build build --target llcg

The generated IR can be compiled to native code using ``clang`` or ``llc``.
For example, to produce an object file directly::

    ./llcg < input.O > prog.ll
    clang -c prog.ll -o prog.o

This bypasses the classic assembler pipeline used by ``cg`` and ``op``.
