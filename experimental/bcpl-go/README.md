# BCPL-Go

This directory contains an experimental port of the BCPL toolchain written in Go.
It targets Go 1.24 and aims to replicate the behaviour of the original shell
driver `src/bcplc` as a first step.  The implementation is incomplete and will
be extended with additional components of the compiler and runtime.
