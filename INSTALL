BCPLC INSTALL

This is an x86 (IA-32) port of an old BCPL compiler (see README)
and should build cleanly on x86 FreeBSD and Linux. Differences
between Linux and FreeBSD versions of the compiler are minor and
are restricted to the system interface file "sys.s" of the compiler
runtime, which is provided in "sys_freebsd.s" and "sys_linux.s"
variants.

The compiler sources, together with object files needed to bootstrap
the compiler, are in the "src" directory. The "tools" directory
contains some utility programs, and one in particular, "cmpltest.bcpl",
will be found useful should you wish to test the compiler once that
has been built and installed. The "docs" directory contains
relevant documentation.

To build and install the compiler in automated fashion (assuming
you're on a supported platform), try

    ./scripts/makeall.sh

followed by (as root)

    ./scripts/makeall.sh install

This project now mandates Clang as the C compiler and makes use of the
C23 language standard.  Ensure `clang` is installed and on your `PATH`
before building.

The build defaults to a 64-bit runtime.  Use ``BITS=32`` with
``scripts/makeall.sh`` or ``make`` in ``src`` (or ``-DBITS=32`` when using CMake)
to create 32-bit binaries or ``BITS=16`` for IA-16 targets.  Set
``CROSS_PREFIX`` as needed for cross builds (for example
``CROSS_PREFIX=i686-linux-gnu-`` or ``CROSS_PREFIX=ia16-elf-``). ``WORDSZ`` is
derived from ``BITS`` so a 64-bit runtime uses 8-byte words, a 32-bit
runtime uses 4-byte words and a 16-bit runtime uses 2-byte words.

Otherwise, change to the "src" directory. Check that the "sys.s"
symbolic link points to either "sys_linux.s" or "sys_freebsd.s",
as appropriate for your system. Enter

    make

to build the compiler, and

    make install

to install the components. By default, these mostly go in
"/usr/local/lib/bcplc". You can also change to the "docs" directory
and

    make install

to install documentation to "/usr/local/share/doc/bcplc".

Should you wish to install the compiler somewhere other than
"/usr/local/lib/bcplc", be sure to change occurrences of this path
in the compiler sources.

Once the compiler is built you can run the "cmpltest" utility from the
"tools" directory to verify the build.  If ``bcplc`` is not yet installed,
use the driver in ``src/``.  It automatically finds the runtime files in
that directory:

    make -C tools BC=../src/bcplc test

After installation simply run ``make test`` in ``tools``.  The test
should conclude:
